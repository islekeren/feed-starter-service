# Court Client Documentation

## Overview

The Court Client is a Python script that runs on court-side computers to connect to the Feed Starter Service via WebSocket. It listens for commands from the central API and executes local tasks such as recording video/audio and live streaming.

## Features

- üîå **WebSocket Connection**: Maintains persistent connection to Feed Starter Service
- üé• **Video Recording**: Records video/audio from RTSP camera streams
- üì° **Live Streaming**: Streams live video to platforms like YouTube
- üíì **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Maintains connection health with periodic pings
- üîÑ **Auto-Reconnection**: Automatically reconnects on connection loss
- üìù **Structured Logging**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging
- üõ°Ô∏è **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup of resources on exit

## API Commands

The client responds to the following WebSocket commands from the Feed Starter Service:

### START_RECORD

Starts video/audio recording from the RTSP camera.

**Command Structure:**

```json
{
  "cmd": "START_RECORD",
  "commandId": "unique-command-id",
  "by": "user-uuid",
  "source": "mobile|admin",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "meta": {
    "quality": "1080p|720p",
    "duration": 1800,
    "format": "mp4"
  }
}
```

**Behavior:**

- Creates timestamped recording file in `recordings/` directory
- Supports configurable duration (default: 30 minutes)
- Records both video and audio streams
- Runs in background, allowing multiple concurrent recordings

### STOP_RECORD

Stops all active video recordings.

**Command Structure:**

```json

  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "meta": {
    "platform": "youtube",
    "stream_key": "your-stream-key",
    "quality": "1080p"
  }
}
```

**Behavior:**

- Currently supports YouTube (more platforms can be added)
- Optimized for low-latency streaming

### STOP_STREAM

Stops active live streaming.

**Command Structure:**

```json
{
  "cmd": "STOP_STREAM",
  "commandId": "unique-command-id",
  "by": "user-uuid",
  "source": "mobile|admin",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Client Registration

When the client starts, it automatically registers with the Feed Starter Service:

```json
{
  "courtId": "court-001",
  "capabilities": ["live", "record"],
  "authToken": "dev-token-1"
}
```

The server responds with an acknowledgment:

```json
{
  "type": "registration-ack",
  "courtId": "court-001",
  "status": "registered",
  "capabilities": ["live", "record"],
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Command Acknowledgments

For each command received, the client sends an acknowledgment:

**Success:**

```json
{
  "commandId": "unique-command-id",
  "success": true
}
```

**Failure:**

```json
{
  "commandId": "unique-command-id",
  "success": false,
  "error": "Description of what went wrong"
}
```

## Logging

The client provides structured logging with the following levels:

- **INFO**: Normal operation messages
- **WARNING**: Non-critical issues
- **ERROR**: Error conditions
- **DEBUG**: Detailed debugging information

Log format:

```
2025-01-01 12:00:00,000 - court-client - INFO - WebSocket connection established
2025-01-01 12:00:01,000 - court-client - INFO - Registration acknowledged by server
2025-01-01 12:00:05,000 - court-client - INFO - Received command: START_RECORD (ID: cmd_123456)
```

## Process Management

The client manages multiple concurrent processes:

- **Recording Processes**: One per active recording
- **Streaming Process**: One active stream at a time
- **Heartbeat Task**: Continuous connection monitoring

All processes are properly tracked and cleaned up on shutdown.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Connection Failed**

```
Connection attempt 1 failed: [Errno 61] Connection refused
```

- Check if Feed Starter Service is running
- Verify SERVER_HOST and SERVER_PORT in .env
- Check network connectivity

**2. Registration Failed**

```
Registration failed: Invalid authentication token
```

- Verify AUTH_TOKEN in .env matches server configuration
- Check COURT_NODES_ALLOWED in server's .env

**3. FFmpeg Not Found**

```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'ffmpeg'
```

- Install FFmpeg system-wide
- Ensure FFmpeg is in PATH

**4. RTSP Connection Issues**

```
Failed to start recording: [rtsp @ 0x...] Connection failed
```

- Verify RTSP_URL is correct
- Check camera credentials and network access
- Test RTSP URL with VLC or similar player

**5. Permission Denied**

```
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'recordings'
```

- Ensure write permissions to recordings directory
- Run with appropriate user permissions

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting in .env:

```bash
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

This provides detailed information about:

- WebSocket message exchange
- Process creation and termination
- FFmpeg command execution
- Network connectivity

### Testing RTSP Connection

Test your RTSP connection independently:

```bash
# Test with FFmpeg
ffmpeg -rtsp_transport tcp -i "rtsp://user:pass@camera-ip:554/stream" -t 10 test.mp4

# Test with VLC
vlc "rtsp://user:pass@camera-ip:554/stream"
```

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: Use secure auth tokens
- **Network**: Consider VPN for remote cameras
- **Storage**: Secure recording storage location
- **Updates**: Keep FFmpeg and Python dependencies updated

## Performance Optimization

- **Recording Quality**: Adjust CRF values (18=high quality, 23=balanced)
- **Encoding Speed**: Use appropriate FFmpeg presets
- **Network**: Ensure sufficient bandwidth for streaming
- **Storage**: Use fast storage for recordings

## Integration with Feed Starter Service

The client is designed to work seamlessly with the Feed Starter Service:

1. **REST to WebSocket Bridge**: Commands from mobile apps are converted to WebSocket messages
2. **Real-time Events**: Client status is broadcast via Server-Sent Events
3. **Command Timeouts**: Failed commands timeout after 3 seconds
4. **Health Monitoring**: Regular heartbeat checks ensure connection health

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

- **Multiple Camera Support**: Handle multiple RTSP streams
- **Stream Quality Selection**: Dynamic quality adjustment
- **Recording Scheduling**: Automated recording schedules
- **Motion Detection**: Start recording on motion events
- **Cloud Storage**: Upload recordings to cloud storage
- **MQTT Support**: Alternative communication protocol
- **Web Interface**: Local web UI for manual control
